The Columbia River and it's tributaries are one of the premier smallmouth bass fishing venues in the United States

00:14.500 --> 00:24.000 line:1
The rocky shoreline, structure laden bottom and constantly changing water levels, currents and temperature provide an ideal environment for smallmouth bass

00:24.500 --> 00:31.000 line:1
You can fish for smallmouth all year round with April through October being the best months for quality fishing

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000 line:1
When fishing for springtime smallmouth bass, we like to use crankbaits like the Rapala X-Rap

00:44.500 --> 00:48.000 line:1
Cast right up against the rocks and slowly reeling back out into deeper water

00:48.500 --> 00:57.000 line:1
Give the lure a few jerks here and there, changing the retrieve speed and sometimes letting the lure sit for a few seconds, then start reeling again

00:57.500 --> 01:06.000 line:1
The crankbaits that resemble small fish work great on the bigger springtime bass before they switch over to their summer diet of crayfish and head for deeper water

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000 line:1
[Splash!]

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000 line:1
[Splash!]

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000 line:1
[Splash!]

01:23.000 --> 01:25.500 line:1
[Splash!]

01:28.000 --> 01:29.500 line:1
[Splash!]

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000 line:1
It's a big one!

01:50.000 --> 01:51.500 line:1
[Splash!]

02:06.000 --> 02:08.500 line:1
That is a big one folks!

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000 line:1
[Splash!]

03:18.000 --> 03:27.000 line:1
Alright, here we go. Second cast with the fresh grub, confidence is high.

03:30.000 --> 03:39.000 line:1
Kind of let it sink to the bottom. The thing is, these smallmouth bass...

03:39.500 --> 03:40.000 line:1
Look at that!

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000 line:1
Unbelievable!

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000 line:1
Two casts, two hits, that's unreal!

04:01.000 --> 04:02.500 line:1
Probably the same fish...

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000 line:1
Really hungry, nope

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000 line:1
[Splash!]

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000 line:1
[Splash, splash!]

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000 line:1
That's two fish in two casts

04:48.500 --> 09:45.000 line:1
I swear, that does not happen every day
